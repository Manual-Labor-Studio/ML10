                    They would never have imagined it, but InChoon and OkSoon Choi paved the way for Manual Labor’s 10th Anniversary when they moved CEO and Founder Sam Choi’s family from Seoul, Korea to America in 1976.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Faced with a language barrier and cultural differences, her parents stood steadfast in their belief in the American dream—and that Sam and her sisters would have more opportunities to be whoever they wanted. A decade later, Manual Labor carries on that legacy: their “roll up your sleeves and get the job done” philosophy—and most importantly, taking pride in everything you do.

                        Manual Labor is proud of all the Great Work over these 10 years: from rebranding B2B tech leaders like Boomi to building ecommerce websites like Rubi Hard Seltzer, ML worked with some of the coolest people at the most interesting brands. ML has found a place as the strategic partner who “connects the dots” for brands and teams: we are there with our hearts and minds for clients to offer outside perspective, guide strategy, and help them make connections they might not otherwise.

                        Since 2020, ML has doubled in size –– which is more than we imagined even three years ago. We've been able to increase capabilities as an organization, which has fostered us to think more about other opportunities. The more great work we do, the more good people we attract, and the more friends and peers we have who inspire each other.

                        Doing great work with good people extends beyond our day-to-day job. As an expression of ML Love, last year and during our tenure, we have donated to the following organizations (below) that are close to every team members' heart.

                    <p class="last_p">
                        It's important for us to build the type of organization around the company we keep, and the organizations who do so much for our society and world.

                        When Sam Choi started Manual Labor in 2012, she had no idea what to expect in 10 years. As we approach this wonderful milestone, one of the ways we want to celebrate is by giving back.

                        However big or small, each one of us has an opportunity to make an impact on another human being. It's hard to ignore the fact that these last few years have been fueled by so much violence and hatred. This is why we are launching the LOVE project.

                        Our hope is that with 10 different designers, we'll create a Love sticker sheet that anyone can purchase with ALL profits donated to two foundations that address human rights and human needs - ACLU and World Central Kitchen.
